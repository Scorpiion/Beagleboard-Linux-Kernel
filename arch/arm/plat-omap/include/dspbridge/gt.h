 * There are two definitions that affect which portions of trace
 * are acutally compiled into the client: GT_TRACE and GT_ASSERT. If
 * GT_TRACE is set to 0 then all trace statements (except for assertions)
 * will be compiled out of the client. If GT_ASSERT is set to 0 then
 * assertions will be compiled out of the client. GT_ASSERT can not be
 * set to 0 unless GT_TRACE is also set to 0 (i.e. GT_TRACE == 1 implies
 * GT_ASSERT == 1).
